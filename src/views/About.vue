      Maximilian Zimmerer is a graphic designer about to enter the final year of
      my BA in Graphic Communication Design (with Creative Computing) at Central
      Saint Martins. My interest lies at the intersection of branding and
      interactivity, and I draw upon the fields of design and computing to
      creatively solve problems. My past experiences include Mother Design
      London, where I worked in various design capacities, including animation,
      branding, and art direction. I am always open to new opportunities and
      freelance work. If you would like to collaborate on a project or have an
      enquiry about my work, please reach out.
